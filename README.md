JavaScript apps of currency converter.

- this JavaScript code appears to be a currency converter, allowing users to convert between different currencies. The code includes several event listeners that listen for changes to the selected currency, the selected date, and the values entered in the input fields. When the user selects a new currency or date, the code fetches the latest exchange rates from a remote API, updates the display to show the new rates, and recalculates the conversion.

- the code includes several helper functions, including formatDate(), which formats the date in a way that is compatible with the API, getRate(), which retrieves the current exchange rate for a given currency, and refreshValue(), which updates the value in the other input field when one of the input fields is changed.

- the code also includes a function to check that the user has only entered numbers in the input fields, and several functions to show and hide the list of available currencies.
